# Historical Data Analysis of the SBF 120
This project focuses on the collection, cleansing, and analysis of historical data for the SBF 120, which comprises the 120 largest market capitalizations in France. The goal is to gain insights into the financial market dynamics and the behavior of these major stocks over time.

## Project Overview
### Data Collection and Cleansing
We begin by gathering historical data for the SBF 120 index components. This step involves ensuring the data's integrity by checking for and addressing any missing or problematic data points. The cleaned dataset serves as a solid foundation for further analysis.

### Beta Calculation
A key part of our analysis is calculating the rolling beta values for each stock. Beta, a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market, is calculated through regression analysis. This process allows us to assess the risk profile of each stock within the context of the market.

### Alpha Calculation
In addition to beta, we compute the alpha for each stock. Alpha represents the stock's performance relative to a benchmark index, providing insights into the stock's ability to generate returns independent of the market's movements.

### Beta Evolution Analysis
We visualize the evolution of beta values over time, offering a dynamic view of market risk as it pertains to individual stocks. This analysis is pivotal for understanding how the risk profiles of stocks change and can inform investment decisions.

### Individual Stock Analysis
The project also includes detailed graphs for each stock, allowing for a granular view of performance and risk metrics over time. This individualized analysis is crucial for identifying specific investment opportunities.

### Diversifiable vs. Non-Diversifiable Risk
A fundamental part of our analysis is distinguishing between diversifiable and non-diversifiable risks within a portfolio. Through graphical representation, we demonstrate how adding stocks to a fund progressively reduces diversifiable risk, while non-diversifiable risk remains unchanged. This visualization underscores the importance of diversification in portfolio management.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the SBF 120 stocks, utilizing historical data to calculate and visualize critical financial metrics such as beta and alpha. By examining the evolution of these metrics and distinguishing between different types of risk, we offer valuable insights for investors looking to optimize their portfolios in the French market.
